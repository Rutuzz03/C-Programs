C Programming Practice

This repository contains a collection of basic C programs I wrote while learning the fundamentals of the C language. Each program focuses on a different concept such as loops, conditionals, strings, recursion, and arrays.

Programs Included

1. Prime Number Check
   Checks whether a given number is prime or not.

2. Convert String Case (without using built-in functions) 
   Converts lowercase characters to uppercase and vice versa without using string functions.

3. Factorial Using Recursion
   Calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive function.

4. Fibonacci Series 
   Prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.

5. Hollow Triangle Pattern 
   Displays a hollow triangle using asterisks (*) based on user input.

6. Palindrome Number Check 
   Checks if a number is a palindrome (reads the same backward and forward).

7. Pyramid Pattern
   Prints a pyramid-shaped pattern using asterisks.

8. Count Vowels in a String 
   Counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string.

9. Transpose of a Matrix 
   Finds the transpose of a 2D matrix.
